Due to growing customers, data is increasing vastly that it is hard to manually read reviews of the customers and categorize whether a review is a Positive or Negative.

'Amazon Fine Food Review Predictor' page takes in reviews of the customers and predicts whether a given review is a Positive or Negative.

Prediction of the food review is based on the machine learning model that I have trained on the data set from the kaggle. Performance - 'accuracy' of this model on cross-validation data is ~91%. Few predictions could be wrong too.

Note: This is just a simple model done as a self-interest project. This is not for any business purpose. This is 'strictly' for a 'learning' purpose.
